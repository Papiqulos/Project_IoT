# DataCrowd

## Overview
DataCrowd is an IoT-based application designed to analyze and provide real-time insights into congestion at public locations such as bus stops, restaurants, and university areas. By leveraging sensor data and external APIs, the app helps commuters, business owners, and city authorities make data-driven decisions.

## Features
- **Real-time Data & Predictions**: Provides live updates on congestion using heatmaps and analytics.
- **Sensor Integration**: Uses CO2, temperature, camera, and other sensors to gather crowd data.
- **Smart Alerts & Notifications**: Notifies users of high congestion areas and suggests alternative routes.
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Enables businesses and authorities to track crowd density and optimize resource allocation.
- **Long-term Urban Planning Tools**: Helps city planners evaluate infrastructure efficiency and propose improvements.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, SQLite, InfluxDB
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Chart.js, Handlebars.js
- **APIs & Data Sources**:
  - Various Google APIs
  - Eduroam Network Data and Other Public Acces Points
  - IoT Sensors (CO2, humidity, temperature)

## Use Cases
### **1. Commuters & Public Transport Users**
- Get real-time crowd information at bus stops.
- Receive suggestions for less crowded transport options.

### **2. Businesses & Authorities**
- Monitor customer density at shops and restaurants.
- Optimize staff allocation based on crowd flow data.
- Improve security and public safety by analyzing movement patterns.


## Future Roadmap
- üì± **Mobile App Development**: Build an Android/iOS app for easier access.
- üß† **AI-based Predictions**: Implement machine learning for more accurate congestion forecasting.
- üåç **City-wide Expansion**: Extend beyond university campus to major public spaces.
- üöå **Public Transport Integration**: Provide live bus tracking and estimated arrival times.
